## Text

To complete this milestone target, you have to implement the To-do page so that it has these four features:

## Required features

1. Make it possible to add a new to-do
2. Mark a to-do as complete or not
3. Allow users to delete a to-do
4. Move completed items to its own section. So there would be `over due`, `due today`, `due later` and `completed items` sections.

## You should also...

* Add tests for all web endpoints.
* Ensure CSRF attacks are prevented.
* Push the code to GitHub.
* Ensure the application is similar to that of the design provided.
* Deploy to Heroku and ensure it works well there. We will be using the live Heroku application URL, to test your submission.
