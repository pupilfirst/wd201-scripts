## Review list

- Does the code look similar to other solutions?

  - It looks like it could be plagiarized

    - **This code looks very similar to existing solutions we've reviewed.**

      I noticed that there is code in this submission that is likely to have been taken from another source. **If you're certain that this isn't the case**, then please ignore the next paragraph.

      To make the best out of the course, you have to write the code yourselves fully. Unfortunately, there is no shortcut to getting good at programming other than writing thousands of lines of code, making mistakes and struggling. We're happy to help if you have any questions in the process, but only you can put in the necessary effort. As always, if you have any doubts regarding how to complete this task, please reach out to us on the Web Development community, here on Pupilfirst School.

    [ADD DETAIL]

    - All EJS files have to be formatted well to get maximum grade. Also ensure there is no commented out code anywhere - if it is not needed, do remove them. We'd covered setting up of auto-formatting for EJS files in the lesson
