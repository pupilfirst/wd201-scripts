# Orientation: Getting help

Let's answer the question of what happens when you get stuck. Or from your perspective, the question would be: "What should I do when I get stuck with something"?

While you're going through this course, you'll probably encounter a few different kinds of places where you might feel stuck, or blocked, or confused. That's okay - it's normal to be stuck, or feel confused. When that happens, you need to ask questions.

The web development community is the place to ask those questions. The coaches and teaching assistants here at Pupilfirst regularly monitor the community for new questions, and we try to make sure that we answer each and every one of your queries.

**But**, you need to help us with that. When you're describing the problem you've encountered on the community, you can use the following process to help us figure out what exactly is going wrong.

Before getting into examples, let me quickly list the information we'd like you to share:

**Describe the issue**
A clear and concise description of what the issue is.

**What I expected would happen**
Details about what you were doing when you encountered the issue, and what you expected would happen.

**The things I've done to try and fix the issue**
Steps you've already taken to try and avoid or solve the issue.

This will tell us what _not_ to suggest.

**Code snippets (optional)**
Snippets of code associated with your problem (don't share full files). If your problem is associated with a submission, let us know which one, and we can take a look at it.

**Logs (optional)**
If there are any error logs, please share relevant/important portions of it. If you're unable to tell which portion might be useful, save everything into a text file, and upload the log file.

**Screenshots (optional)**
If there's visual issues that you're discussing, share screenshots - please try to avoid sharing any personal information in your screenshots - remember that community posts are visible to all students.

As you can probably tell, the basic idea here is to share as much useful information as possible at the _beginning_ of your interaction - this helps save time in back and forth messages collecting required info.

This pattern isn't something we came up with either.

This sort of structured approach to issue reporting is common in the industry. If you want to report an issue on a code repository, you'll often find yourself being asked a series of questions. The purpose is the same - to gather as much useful information as possible when a thread of conversation starts - this helps resolve issues quicker.

That's it for this video. In this lesson, you'll find a few examples of the kind of issues you might encounter, and how we think you should ask questions in the community regarding those issues - these are just examples to give you an idea of how we expect you to approach such situations.
