# Screen Recording

There are _several_ ways in which you can record a video of your desktop and share it with here. In this video we're going to recommend on approach that's probably the easiest that we've seen, and that's a tool called _Loom_.

Loom is a third-party service, and it has a free tier that you can use to publicly share recordings of your desktop, along with your audio. So you can use Loom to record your screen while you're describing something. It's sort of similar to what I'm doing right now, but much simpler to set up and use. I'll quickly demo how that works.

To get started, sign up for Loom, download the desktop application and sign in on it using the same method that you used to sign up. I've got it already installed on my system. When you start up Loom, it should be configured to record your screen only - your full screen, and you can choose to overlay your webcam and include audio from your mic. I've got the webcam turned off, but the mic on.

After the countdown, Loom will start recording - you can demonstrate whatever it is that you want to show us. Ideally, you should also talk us through it - describe what you're doing and seeing. Then when you're done, just click the stop button to the left. That will instantly take you to a webpage whose URL you can share. Simply copy and paste the URL of this webpage into the community post that you're creating and anyone who reads the message will also be able to see the video.

That's it. Feel free to use any other tool if that's your preference. Loom is simply what we recommend because of how easy it is to set up and use. Note that as of recording this video, the free plan of Loom has a 25 video limit. If you run into the limit, the easiest option is to simply delete older videos - that shouldn't cause you any inconvenience.
