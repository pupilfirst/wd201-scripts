# Orientation: Plagiarism

> Slideshow: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PbWZ0Qrok8YNEndGgSy7E6f7auvPPVmZlivQccqSbBQ/edit?usp=sharing

In this level, you're going to be submitting code for review, for the first time, as a part of the course. Before you start writing code for your submission, there's a topic that we want to discuss up-front - plagiarism.

If you're unaware of what plagiarism is, there will be links below this video that will help you learn. In the context of this course, where you'll be submitting code that you write for review, plagiarism will mean submitting someone else's prior work.

Because this course involves submitting code as Github links that are publicly accessible, if you search for it, you're going to find it very easy to find solutions for all of the assignments that you'll be given. You _might_ be tempted to look up these existing solutions before you work on your own.

Please don't do it. There are two main reasons for this:

## 1. The course is designed to force you to make mistakes.

The way is course is designed, we fully expect you make mistakes in your earlier submissions - we actually use that knowledge to give you feedback for your submissions that you will use to improve your submission, and also your grades. Unlike other courses or subjects that you might be used to, this course does not stop you from redoing your work. After all, no one in the industry ever blocks an engineer from trying to improve their work.

## 2. You'll rob yourself of the challenge (and the fun).

Now the second, and better reason, is that if you're _truly_ interested in learning more about web development, copying some else's work is pretty much the same as robbing yourself from a real learning experience. You can't cheat your way to learning. It's probably going to be a bit difficult at times. And that's okay. Meaningful work in the field of programming is difficult at times, and often involves continuous learning. The Challenge _is_ the fun.

## Don't get stuck, though.

If you're ever really stuck, or getting frustrated - ask for help - that's another one of the things that you'll need to learn. You'll need to learn _when_ to ask for help, _how_ to ask to help, and how to interpret the help that you get - we have a lesson in this course that covers that topic.

## All solutions are public

Now I've stressed that you shouldn't look for solutions, so it might seem odd that we (the course authors) are making solutions for all of the assignments public. This course includes a link to a Github repository that actually contains every single solution.

Don't look at them - at least, not until you've received a maximum grade in a given assignment.

Once you've received a maximum grade - once you feel that there's no way that you can write your code better - take a look at the solution and compare it to what other programmers have written. Reading other people's code _is_ something you should practise doing - but only to understand, not to copy, and definitely never to simply complete an assignment.
