## Problem Description
To complete this milestone, you have to:
  
1. Create a new repository in your GitHub account.
2. Initialize a new git repository in your computer, on the **First Node.js program** project folder.
3. Open the `index.js` file, and at the end, export the `hello` function, which we will use to test your submission.
   1. So add this line: `module.exports = hello; // Let's export this function`
4. Commit all files locally with proper messages.
5. Connect the local repository to your GitHub account by simply following the steps shown in GitHub.
6. Push the code to the GitHub repository and share the URL with us.


Also, we'd like you to practise using git by working through the [Git-it Guide](http://jlord.us/git-it/).

Have fun!
