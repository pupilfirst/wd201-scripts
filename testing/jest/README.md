## Script

In this lesson, we will learn how to test our JavaScript codebase using the `jest` framework.

> Action: todo open https://jestjs.io/ in browser

According to the website,

> "Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity."

Also, it works with Node.js, React, Angular etc. Basically, it supports testing popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks.

Let's open our project in Visual Studio Code and add `jest` to our project. Let's head to the integrated terminal and run the command.

> Action: run following command

```sh
npm install jest --save-dev
```

Let us tell git not to track the `node_module` folder by adding it to `.gitignore` file. Let's create a file named `.gitignore` in the root of the project and add `node_modules/` to it.

> Action: create a file `.gitignore` with following content.

```
node_modules/
```

We currently have jest in our package.json as a dev dependency. Let's replace the `test` command in the `scripts` section in `package.json` file to use `jest`

> Action: Open package.json in editor, and edit the npm test script

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
```

Now, let's try running the test script. We will use the npm script that we edited to run the test suite.

> Action: switch to the terminal and run the following command.

```sh
npm test
```

We can see that `jest` is complaining that it didn't find any tests. With the default configuration, jest looks for files in `__tests__` folder or files with name that ends with `.spec.js` or `.test.js`.

Let's create a folder with name `__tests__` and create a file named `first.js`

> Action: create a folder in project root with name `__tests__` and a file with name `first.js`.

We do testing by having different test suites, with several test cases within a suite.

Jest comes with various `globals` that can be used in tests without explicitly importing it.

> Action: open https://jestjs.io/docs/api and highlight the `Globals` and `Expect`.

The `describe` can be used to group together related tests. And each such test can be written using `test` block. Also we assert or check the correctness using the `expect` construct. Let's write our first test using `Jest`.

> Action: switch VS Code and open the `first.js` file.

```js
describe("First Test Suite", () => {
  test("My First Test Case", () => {
    expect(true).toEqual(true);
  });
});
```

The `describe` takes two arguments, the first one is the test suite name. The second one is a method which wraps all the related tests in the suite.

Here let's verify whether the value `true` is equal to `true`. Save the file. Let's head to the terminal and run the command again.

> Action: run the test command again

```sh
npm test
```

Now, we can see that, jest picks up our file and it reports everything has passed. Let's see what happens when we change the test and make it fail intentionally.

> Action: edit the test

```js
describe("First Test Suite", () => {
  test("My First Test Case", () => {
    expect(true).toEqual(false);
  });
});
```

Here, we are expecting the value `true` to be equal to `false`, which is obviously not correct. Let's see what jest reports.

Switch to the terminal and run the command again.

> Action: Run the test command again.

```sh
npm test
```

Now, we can see Jest reporting error.

We can now try to write tests for our todo application. Let's remove `first.js` file. Let's edit our `todo.js` file to remove `console.log` and expose few other functions like `overdue`, `dueLater`, `dueToday` etc.

```js
// todo.js
const todoList = () => {
  let all = [];
  const add = (todoItem) => {
    all.push(todoItem);
  };
  const markAsComplete = (index) => {
    all[index].completed = true;
  };

  const overdue = () => {
    return all.filter(
      (item) =>
        item.dueDate < new Date().toLocaleDateString("en-CA") && !item.completed
    );
  };

  const dueToday = () => {
    return all.filter(
      (item) =>
        item.dueDate === new Date().toLocaleDateString("en-CA") &&
        !item.completed
    );
  };

  const dueLater = () => {
    return all.filter(
      (item) =>
        item.dueDate > new Date().toLocaleDateString("en-CA") && !item.completed
    );
  };

  const completed = () => {
    return all.filter((item) => item.completed);
  };
  return { all, add, markAsComplete, overdue, dueToday, dueLater, completed };
};

module.exports = todoList;
```

Now create a file named `todo.js` in `__tests__` folder

> Action: Add following code:

```js
// __tests__/todo.js
let todoList = require("../todo");

const { all, markAsComplete, add } = todoList();
/* eslint-disable no-undef */
describe("Todo List Test Suite", () => {
  beforeAll(() => {
    // Seed the test data
    const today = new Date();
    const oneDay = 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000;
    [
      {
        title: "Buy milk",
        completed: false,
        dueDate: new Date(today.getTime() - 2 * oneDay).toLocaleDateString(
          "en-CA"
        ),
      },
      {
        title: "Pay rent",
        completed: false,
        dueDate: new Date().toLocaleDateString("en-CA"),
      },
      {
        title: "Submit assignment",
        completed: false,
        dueDate: new Date(today.getTime() + 2 * oneDay).toLocaleDateString(
          "en-CA"
        ),
      },
    ].forEach(add);
  });
  test("Should add a new todo", () => {});
});
```

We will first test creating a new to-do item. We have `add` method to add a new to-do item to the list. Currently we don't have any entries. Let's make sure of that.

> Action: add the following line to the test.

```js
expect(all.length).toEqual(0);
```

Now, let's add a new item and verify whether it worked or not.

> Action: add following code to the test block

```js
add({
  title: "A test item",
  completed: false,
  dueDate: new Date().toLocaleDateString("en-CA"),
});

expect(all.length).toEqual(1);
```

Let's try running our tests. Switch to the terminal and execute the command.

> Action: execute `npm test` in terminal

```sh
npm test
```

You can see that jest has picked up our new test and the test has passed.

Let's add one more test. Let's test `markAsComplete` function. For that, let's add a new `test` block in our `__tests__/todo.js` file.

> Action: Add the following code.

```js
test("Should mark a Todo as complete", () => {
  expect(all.length).toEqual(1);
  expect(all[0].completed).toEqual(false);
  markAsComplete(0);
  expect(all[0].completed).toEqual(true);
});
```

We have already added a to-do item to the list. It was marked incomplete while creating it. We have then invoked `markAsComplete` passing it's index ie, 0. And we check again whether the item is completed or not.

### Conclusion

So, in this lesson, we have learned how to use Jest and write test cases. See you in the next lesson.

## Text

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a testing framework that supports testing of React, Node.js and Angular projects. We can add jest to our project by running the following command.

```sh
npm install jest --save-dev
```

To run our tests using jest, edit the `package.json` file to contain the test script.

```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
```

By default `jest` looks for tests in the folder named `__tests__` or files that end with `.test.js` and `.spec.js`.
